TASK : 3.RAM DESIGN
This project focuses on designing a simple synchronous RAM (Random Access Memory) module using Verilog. The RAM performs essential read and write operations on the rising edge of the clock signal, ensuring data is stored and retrieved in a controlled and predictable manner. The module accepts address, data input, and control signals for enabling read/write functionalities. A comprehensive Verilog testbench is provided to simulate various scenarios and verify the correct behavior of the RAM. All design files, including the RAM module, testbench, and simulation outputs, are included in the repository. This project demonstrates a foundational concept in digital system design, helping learners understand how memory components function at the hardware level using HDL.![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-27 at 1 00 15 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe0088c4-876c-4502-9a33-5b51e8c15bd4)
